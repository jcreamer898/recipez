# Chili Lime Chicken
This recipe combines many of the spices that I grew up with and that have become a distinctive part of much of my cooking including dishes such as chili Colorado, posole, and Frontera(&lt;sup&gt;&amp;trade;&lt;/sup&gt;)-style carne asada. I would describe this dish as more Tex-Mex or New Mexican than Mexican. Serve on a bed of rice or slice thinly for use in tacos or to top a green salad.

## Ingredients
- ¼ cup ancho chili powder
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1 tablespoon garlic powder
- 1 tablespoon onion powder
- ½ teaspoon ground cumin
- ½ teaspoon chipotle chili powder
- ⅔ cup canola oil, or more as needed
- 1 large lime, juiced
- 8 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves

## Instructions
1. Combine ancho chili powder, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, and chipotle powder in a medium glass or ceramic bowl. Whisk in canola oil and lime juice until well combined; thin with additional canola oil if mixture seems too thick.
2. Arrange chicken in a glass or ceramic baking dish and pour the marinade over the chicken, covering it completely. Marinate in the refrigerator for 3 hours.
3. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
4. Arrange the chicken on the baking sheet; do not crowd. Discard any excess marinade.
5. Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the centers, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from the oven and let stand for 5 to 6 minutes.
